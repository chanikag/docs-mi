The following are some ways to troubleshoot errors you may encounter when working with the Micro Integrator extension for Visual Studio Code (MI for VS Code).

## Fixing window clashes and design errors in the graphical view

If you encounter errors while working with the Micro Integrator extension for Visual Studio Code, such as window clashes, frozen views, or errors while designing integrations using the graphical view, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Go to the **Command Palette** at the top of the Visual Studio Code interface.

2. Type `>` to display the available commands.

    - Alternatively, on macOS press `Command`+`Shift`+`P`, and on Windows press `Control`+`Shift`+`P` to open the **Command Palette**.

        <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/develop/mi-for-vscode/command-palette.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/develop/mi-for-vscode/command-palette.png" alt="Command Palette" width="80%"></a>

3. Select **MI: Refresh**.

    <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/develop/mi-for-vscode/mi-refresh.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/develop/mi-for-vscode/mi-refresh.png" alt="MI Refresh" width="50%"></a>

This will refresh the extension and may resolve the encountered issues.
