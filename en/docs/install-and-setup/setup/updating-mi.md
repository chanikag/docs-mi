# Updating WSO2 Micro Integrator

WSO2 introduces [WSO2 Updates](https://updates.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/), which is a command-line utility that allows you to get the latest updates that are available for a particular product release.Â These updates include the latest bug fixes and security fixes that are released by WSO2 after a particular product version is released. Therefore, you do not need to wait and upgrade to the next product release to get these bug fixes.

The WSO2 updates tool allows you to update your currently used product by fetching updates from the server and merging all configurations and files. The tool also gives backup and restore capability.

For more information, see [Using Update Tool](https://updates.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/updates/update-tool/).
