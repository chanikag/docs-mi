# Google Ads Connector Overview

Google Ads are customizable advertising units that allow businesses to reach their target audience on Google and its associated platforms. These ads can be tailored with various formats, targeting options, and budget settings.

The Google Ads Connector allows you to access the Google Ads API. This lets you create, update, and delete ad campaigns and ads.

To see the Google Ads Connector, go to the [WSO2 Connector Store](https://store.wso2.com) and search for "Google".
