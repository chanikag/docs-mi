# Kafka Connector Example

Given below is a sample scenario that demonstrates how to send messages to a Kafka broker via Kafka topics. The publishMessages operation allows you to publish messages to the Kafka brokers via Kafka topics.

## What you'll build

Given below is a sample API that illustrates how you can connect to a Kafka broker with the `init` operation and then use the `publishMessages` operation to publish messages via the topic. It exposes Kafka functionalities as a RESTful service. Users can invoke the API using HTTP/HTTPs with the required information.

API has the context `/publishMessages`. It will publish messages via the topic to the Kafka server.

The following diagram illustrates all the required functionality of the Kafka service that you are going to build.

If you do not want to configure this yourself, you can simply [get the project](#get-the-project) and run it.

## Set up kafka

Before you begin, set up Kafka by following the instructions in [Setting up Kafka]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/kafka-connector/setting-up-kafka/).

## Set up the integration project

1. Follow the steps in [create integration project]({{base_path}}/develop/create-integration-project/) guide to set up the Integration Project.

2. Create a new Kafka connection. 
    1. Goto `Local Entries` -> `Connections` and click on the `+` sign. 
    2. Select  `KafkaTransport` connector.

    3. Use the following values to create the connection. 
        - Connection Name - `KafkaConnection`
        - Connection Type - `kafka`
        - Bootstrap Servers - `localhost:9092` 
        - Key Serializer Class - `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`
        - Value Serializer Class - `org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer`
        - Pooling Enabled - `false`

## Create the integration logic

1. Select Micro Integrator and click on `+` in APIs to create a REST API. Provide `KafkaTransport` as name and `publishMessages` as context.
   <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/kafka-conn-add-api.png" title="Adding a Rest API" width="800" alt="Adding a Rest API"/>

2. Create a resource with the below configuration.<br/>
    <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/kafka-conn-add-resource.png" title="Adding API Resource" width="400" alt="Adding API Resource"/>

3. Select the created resource and add the `PublishMessages` operation.
    <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/kafka-conn-add-operation.png" title="Adding operation" width="800" alt="Adding operation"/>

    - Use the following values to fill the appearing form.
        - Connection - `KafkaConnection`
        - Topic - `test`
        - Partition Number - `0`

        <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/kafka-conn-config-operation.png" title="Configure operation" width="400" alt="Configure operation"/>

The source view of the XML configuration file of the API will be as below.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <api context="/publishMessages" name="KafkaTransport" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <resource methods="POST">
        <inSequence>
            <kafkaTransport.publishMessages configKey="KafkaConnection">
                <topic>test</topic>
                <partitionNo>0</partitionNo>
                <keySchemaSoftDeleted>false</keySchemaSoftDeleted>
                <valueSchemaSoftDeleted>false</valueSchemaSoftDeleted>
            </kafkaTransport.publishMessages>
        </inSequence>
        <faultSequence>
        </faultSequence>
    </resource>
    </api>
```

Now, we can export the imported connector and the API into a single CAR application. The CAR application needs to be deployed during server runtime. 

## Export integration logic as a carbon application 

To export the project, please refer to the [build and export the carbon application]({{base_path}}/develop/deploy-artifacts/#build-and-export-the-carbon-application) guide. 

## Get the project

You can download the ZIP file and extract the contents to get the project code.

    <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/download-zip.png" width="200" alt="Download ZIP">
</a>

## Deployment

To deploy and run the project, please refer to the [build and run]({{base_path}}/develop/deploy-artifacts/#build-and-run) guide.

You can further refer the application deployed through the CLI tool. See the instructions on [managing integrations from the CLI]({{base_path}}/observe-and-manage/managing-integrations-with-micli).
    
## Test

**Create a topic**:

Letâ€™s create a topic named `test` with a single partition and only one replica.
Navigate to the <KAFKA_HOME> and run following command. 
```bash
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test     
```

**Sample request**:
   
Send a message to the Kafka broker using a CURL command or sample client.
```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"name":"sample"}' "http://localhost:8290/publishMessages" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -v
```

**Expected response**: 
   
Navigate to the <KAFKA_HOME> and run the following command to verify the messages:
```bash
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
```

See the following message content:
```bash
{"name":"sample"}
```   

This demonstrates how the Kafka connector publishes messages to the Kafka brokers.
