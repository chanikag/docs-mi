# ISO8583 Connector Example

Given below is a sample scenario that demonstrates how the WSO2 ISO8583 Connector sends an ISO8583 message to financial networks using the integration runtime of WSO2.

## What you'll build

This example demonstrates how to expose core banking system functionality working with ISO8583 protocol as an API. Here, the integration runtime acts as ISO8583 terminal for the banking network. In this scenario to mock the banking network we use a test mock server.

Given below is a sample API that illustrates how you can configure ISO8583 with the `init` operation and then use the `iso8583.sendMessage` operation to send an ISO8583 message for financial transactions.

To know further information about the `init` and `iso8583.sendMessage` operations please refer to this link.

If you do not want to configure this yourself, you can simply [get the project](#get-the-project) and run it.

## Set up the integration project

Follow the steps in [create integration project]({{base_path}}/develop/create-integration-project/) guide to set up the integration project. 

1. Select the Micro Integrator Extension and click on `+` in APIs to create a REST API.

2. Specify the API name as `SendisoTestAPI` and API context as `/sendiso`. You can go to the source view of the XML configuration file of the API and copy the following configuration (source view).

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <api context="/sendiso" name="SendisoTestAPI" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
       <resource methods="POST">
           <inSequence>
               <log>
                   <property name="status" value="Sending_an_ISO8583_Message"/>
               </log>
               <iso8583.init>
                   <serverHost>localhost</serverHost>
                   <serverPort>5010</serverPort>
               </iso8583.init>
               <iso8583.sendMessage/>
               <respond/>
           </inSequence>
           <faultSequence/>
       </resource>
   </api>
   ```
Now we can export the imported connector and the API into a single CAR application. CAR application is the one we are going to deploy to server runtime. 
   
## Export integration logic as a CApp
In order to export the project, refer to the [build and export the carbon application]({{base_path}}/develop/deploy-artifacts/#build-and-export-the-carbon-application) guide. 

## Get the project

You can download the ZIP file and extract the contents to get the project code.

</a>

## Deployment

In order to deploy and run the project, refer the [build and run]({{base_path}}/develop/deploy-artifacts/#build-and-run) guide.

You can further refer the application deployed through the CLI tool. See the instructions on [managing integrations from the CLI]({{base_path}}/observe-and-manage/managing-integrations-with-micli).
  
## Test

Invoke the API as shown below using the curl command. Curl application can be downloaded from [here](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

   ```
          curl -v POST -d 
          '<ISOMessage>
               <header>AAAAaw==</header>
               <data>
                <field id="104">000001161204171926FABCDE123ABD06414243</field>
                <field id="109">000termid1210Community106A5DFGR1112341234234</field>

               </data>
           </ISOMessage>' "http://localhost:8290/sendiso" -H "Content-Type:application/xml"
   ```
**Expected Response**:
   
   ```
          <ISOMessage>
          <header>MDIxMA==</header>
          <data>
          <field id="0">8000</field>
          <field id="23">000</field>
          </data>
          </ISOMessage>  
   ```
